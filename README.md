# AI  
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.  
AI is good at repeating tasks with lots of examples but can’t think like humans.  
AI has risks, it can be bias, unfair or give wrong outputs.   

**Types of AI**  
ANI (Artificial narrow intelligence)- These only perform one task e.g. speackers.  
Generative AI- builds new content like pictures or stories based on what it has learned e.g. ChatGPT.  
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)- Can do anything a human can do.

**How to Build an AI Project**  
1. Get data (lots of examples),
2. Train the AI model with that data,
3. Test it to make sure it works well,
4. Use it in the real world (Deployment).

**How to choose AI project**  
Before committing to a big AI project, conduct due diligence on it.  
Go through its:  
-Technical diligence (Making sure that the AI system you want to build is doable).  
-Business diligence( Make sure project is valuable for the business).  

**AI Team**  
-Software Engineer: Responsible for writing specialized software for tasks like executing commands.  
-Machine Learning Engineers: Focus on developing algorithms, gathering data, and training models to make sure they produce correct outputs.  
-AI Product Managers: Determine what AI products to build.
-Machine Learning Researchers: Study ways to improve how machines learn.  
-Data Scientists: Use data to help businesses make smart decisions.  
-Data Engineers: Organize and manage large amounts of data safely.

# Machine Learning
A branch of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being programmed for every task.  

**How It Works:**  
1. Collect data.  
2. Train model (computer looks for patterns in that data).   
3. Deploy model (It then makes predictions or decisions based on what it learned).  

**Types of Machine Learning**  
Supervised Learning – The computer learns from labeled data.  
Unsupervised Learning – The computer finds patterns in unlabeled data.  
Reinforcement Learning – The computer learns by trial and error.  
**Data is information that can be collected, stored, and used to learn or make decisions.**   

Deep Learning is special kind of machine learning good for things like speech and image recognition.

# Data Science  
The process of using data to learn and solve problems.  
**How it works:**  
1. Collect data.
2. Analyza data.
3. Suggest hypotheses (Make smart guesses/ pridictions)  
**Without clean and organized data, AI will fail.**
